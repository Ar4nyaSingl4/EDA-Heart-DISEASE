# EDA-Heart-DISEASE
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a critical step in understanding and analyzing heart disease datasets. It involves summarizing key statistics and visualizing relationships between features such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, heart rate, and exercise-induced angina. EDA helps identify patterns, trends, and potential anomalies that may influence heart disease outcomes. By examining correlations and distributions, insights can be drawn to guide feature selection, model building, and better decision-making for predictive analytics in healthcare.
